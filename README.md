# Dataset-of-Microwave-Absorption-Parameters-for-all-Elements
In this project, I intend to provide a datasets of parameters related to microwave absorption , for all elements. 
These are effective principal quantum number, atomic radii, orbital exponents, spatial energy parameter, Effective Energy Parameter. 
There are two datasets first including the 
calculation for the effective principal quantum number and other for the energy parameters. A python code is also provided with the functions for the calculations.
